This page summarizes some of the codes and scripts that I use working with PALM model.

# bin

This folder contains all bash scripts. Including 
## grb2nc.sh
The code convert COSMO reanalysis data "grb" format to NETCDF one for a user-defined subdomain. You can modify code if you wish to convert the entire grb-file to netcdf-file. you need to load cdo and netcdf modules in order to use this script.
